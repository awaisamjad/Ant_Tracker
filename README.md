# Description of the files

### 3D Animation videos
- where the 3D animation of the ants paths are stored. only done for colony 6 video 2 and colony 6 video 5

### Ant Videos
- where the videos used for the tracking in Ant_Video_Tracking.py are stored 
- 3 videos are slowed down versions to see if they would make a btter tracking system
- one is a video found online of ants agains a white background

### Ant Path Generator
- contains a processing sketch to create the visualisation. this was later abandoned to do it in python but was used a reference
- gifs were created of 3 ants paths for testing
- copy of the data is stored here as it allowed processing to access it

### SVG Graphs
- svg graphs of each colony and video.

### Labelled PNG Graphs
- lablled png graphs

### Sorted Data
- the data sorted by colony and video sored as csv's

### 3d_Graph_col6_vid2.py
- python script for colony 6 video 2 3D graph

### 3d_Graph_col6_vid4.py
- python script for colony 6 video 4 3D graph

### ant_path_generator_python.py
- python script for creating the visualisation using the pygame module

### Ant_Video_Tracking.py
- python script for detecting the ants in a video from the Ant videos folder

### main.ipynb
- where the data was sorted and turned into csv's
- where the ant paths were selected for the visulisation

### raw_tracking_dataset.csv
